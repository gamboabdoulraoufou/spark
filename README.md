- Création et installation de spark
- Configuration basique de spark
- Deploiement de spark sur un cluster

_Caractérisques:_
- 2 VM sur Google Compute Engine
- OS: Ubuntu 12.04
- OpenJDK 1.6.0_27
- Scala 2.9.3
- Maven 3.0.4
- Python 2.7.3 
- Git 1.7.9.5 
  
  
### Installation des pré-requis
Créer un utilusateur sparkmanager
```sh
sudo adduser sparkmanager # mot de passe: spark
```

Désactiver le mot de passe du compte utilisateur sparkmanager
```sh
sudo sh -c "echo 'sparkmanager ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers"
```

Connecter en tant que sparkmanager
```sh
su - sparkmanager # Password is spark
```

Générer une clé ssh sur le noeud maitre
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ""
```

Copier la clé publique sur les autres machines du cluster 
Cela se fait par l'ajour de la clé dans les métadonnées
```sh
nano ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
```
Install Oracle's JDK6
```sh
# you may or may not want to remove open-jdk (not necessary):
sudo apt-get purge openjdk*

# to add PPA source repository to apt:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java

# to refresh the sources list:
sudo apt-get update

# to install JDK 6:
sudo apt-get install oracle-java6-installer
```

That should install java and make it default, all in one go.  
If you check with:  

```sh
cd /etc/alternatives
ls -lat
```

... you should see that `java` symlink points to JRE, that's inside our newly installed JDK:

![java default](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/java-default.PNG)


**Verifier `JAVA_HOME`**  

For a good measure, I like to set `JAVA_HOME` explicitly (_Spark_ checks for its existence).

```sh
# check where it currently points
echo $JAVA_HOME
# if you're doing this on a fresh machine
# and you just installed Java for the first time
# JAVA_HOME should not be set (you get an empty line when you echo it)

################## either set it system wide ####################
sudo echo "JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle" >> /etc/environment

# to reload
source /etc/environment

################## or only for the current user #################
echo "JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/" >> ~/.pam_environment

# to reload
source ~/.pam_environment

#################################################################

# now try it out
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

> `.pam_environment` is the new `.bashrc`. [What?](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables#Session-wide_environment_variables)

### Scala
```sh
# Install Scala
sudo apt-get remove scala-library scala
wget http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/scala-2.11.4.deb
sudo dpkg -i scala-2.11.4.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install scala 
```

```sh
# to check whether the installation went well:
scala -version

# should spit out:
Scala code runner version 2.11.4 -- Copyright 2002-2011, LAMP/EPFL
```

**Check/set `SCALA_HOME`**  

```sh
# I'll set SCALA_HOME only for my user sessions
# who knows, maybe my wife will like to use another version :)
echo "SCALA_HOME=/usr/share/java" >> ~/.pam_environment

# again, same as with java, to reload:
source ~/.pam_environment

# now try it out
echo $SCALA_HOME
```

### Install Maven
_Skip if you'll choose to install Spark from binaries (see the next section for more info)_
This one is dead simple: 

```sh
sudo apt-get install maven
```

Be warned, a large download will take place.  
It is flat out awful that a dependency & build management tool may become so bloated that it **weighs 146MB**, but that's a whole [different story](https://github.com/mbonaci/mbo-storm/wiki/Storm-setup-in-Eclipse-with-Maven,-Git-and-GitHub#a-note-about-maven)...

## Install Spark
We'll try, like a couple of hoodlums, to build the cutting edge, development version of Spark ourselves. Screw binaries, right :)  
  
If you were to say that this punk move will just complicate things, you wouldn't be far from truth. So, if you'd like to simplify things a bit, and avoid possible alpha-version bugs down the road, go ahead and download (and install) Spark binaries from [here](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/downloads.html).  
If, on the other hand, you're not scared, keep following instructions.  
Just kidding.  
No, honestly, I really suggest that you use binaries (and skip to [OMG! section](#omg-i-have-a-running-spark-in-my-home)).

> Back to the story, so my grandma was building Spark from source the other day and she noticed a couple of build errors...

- to get the Spark source code:

```sh
# clone the development repo:
# git clone git://github.com/apache/incubator-spark.git
git clone git://github.com/apache/spark.git -b branch-1.3

# go into it:
cd spark
```

- we'll use _Maven_ to build _Spark_:

> But what these params bellow actually mean?  
> Spark will build against Hadoop 1.0.4 by default, so if you want to read from HDFS (optional), use your version of Hadoop. If not, choose any version.  
> For more options and additional details, take a look at the official [ instructions on building Spark with Maven](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/building-with-maven.html).

```sh
# first, to avoid the notorious 'permgen' error
# increase the amount memory available to the JVM:
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1300M -XX:MaxPermSize=512M -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m"

# then trigger the build:
mvn -Phadoop2-yarn -Dhadoop.version=2.0.5-alpha -Dyarn.version=2.0.5-alpha -DskipTests clean package
```

> If you did everything right, the build process should complete without a glitch, in about 15 to 30 minutes (downloads take the majority of that time), depending on your hardware. The only type of notifications should be Scala deprecation and duplicate class warnings, but both can be ignored.

You should see something like this by the end of the compilation process:

![spark-build-success](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/spark-build-success.png)

The above is from Ubuntu, with Core-i7-Quad 2.6GHz and 8GB of RAM.  
And this is the same thing from Xubuntu, with Core-i5-Duo 3.2GHz and 4GB of RAM:

![spark-build-success](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/spark-build-success-xubuntu.png)

> Since I have successfully built Spark with _mvn_ I have never used _sbt (Scala Build Tool)_ to build it, but that option is also available to you.

## OMG! I have a running Spark in my home

> ... IN MY HOME, in my bedroom, where my wife sleeps! Where my children come to play with their toys. In my home.

Yes, that was my general feeling when I first connected to a Spark master with Scala repl:

![spark-repl](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/spark-repl.png)

### How to get there

OK, we installed all the prerequisites and successfully built Spark. Now, it's finally time to have some fun with it.

To get the ball rolling, start the Spark master:

```sh
# to start the Spark master on your localhost:
./sbin/start-master.sh

# outputs master's class and log file info:
starting org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master, logging to /home/mbo/spark/bin/../
logs/spark-mbo-org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master-1-mbo-ubuntu-vbox.out
```
Lauch to http://IP:8080 

```sh
./bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker spark://IP:PORT
```

Connecting an Application to the Cluster 
```sh
./bin/spark-shell --master spark://IP:PORT
```

If you need more info on how the startup process works, take a look [here](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html).  
  
To check out master's web console, open http://localhost:8080/. Nice, ha?

![master's web console](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/spark-web-console.png)

### Starting slave workers

> Our beloved master is lonely, with no one to boss around. Let's fix that.

Spark _master_ requires passwordless `ssh` login to its _slaves_, and since we're building a standalone Spark cluster, we'll need to facilitate _localhost to localhost_ passwordless connection.

If your private key has a password, you'll need to generate a new key and copy its public part to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:

```sh
# generate new public-private key pair:
ssh-keygen

# just press enter both times, when asked for password

# to add your key to authorized keys list on your machine:
ssh-copy-id mbo@mbo-xubuntu

# where 'mbo' is your username and 'mbo-xubuntu' is your localhost's name
# confirm by typing 'yes' and then enter your login password, when asked
```

That should look similar to this:

![ssh-keygen](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/ssh-keygen-xubuntu.PNG)

> If you get stuck, follow [these instructions](http://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/openssh-server.html#openssh-keys), and [these](http://askubuntu.com/a/296574/116447), if needed.
  
> Be careful not to open a door for malicious intrusion attempts. If you're new to `ssh`, [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH) is a short and sweet intro to _openssh_.
  
If you don't have `ssh` server installed, you'll need to get one:

```sh
# to check whether the openssh server is installed
service ssh status

# if that returns "unrecognized service", then follow instructions:

# to install openssh-server (most Ubuntu versions come only with ssh client)
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

# then check whether the openssh server is up (should be automatically started)
service ssh status

# if not
service ssh start
```

### Actually starting slave workers

To tell Spark to run 4 workers on each slave machine, we'll create a new config file:

```sh
# create spark-env.sh file using the provided template:
cp ./conf/spark-env.sh.template ./conf/spark-env.sh

# append a configuration param to the end of the file:
echo "export SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES=4" >> ./conf/spark-env.sh
```

> Now we've hopefully prepared everything to finally launch 4 slave workers, on the same machine where our master is already lurking around (slaves will be assigned random ports, both for _repl_ and _http_ access, thus avoiding port collision).

```sh
# to start slave workers:
./sbin/start-slaves.sh
```

You should see something similar to this:

![4 slaves start](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/spark-4-slaves-started.png)

If you now refresh master's web console, you should see 4 slaves listed there:

![4 slaves in web console](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/spark-master-web-console-4-slaves.png)

Clicking on a slave's link opens its web console:

![slave web console](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/spark-slaves-web-console.png)

### Starting and stopping the whole cluster

Since you're going to start and stop master and slaves multiple times, let's quickly go through the simplified procedure of starting and stopping the whole cluster with one command:

```sh
# first, let's stop the master and all the slaves:
./bin/stop-all.sh

# then, to start all of them in one go:
./bin/start-all.sh
```

## Configuring _log4j_
I regularly configure log4j to write to a log file, instead of a console.
If you'd like to set up the same thing yourself, you'll need to modify `log4j.properties` located in `spark/conf/` directory. Something like this:

```sh
# Initialize root logger
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, FILE
# Set everything to be logged to the console
log4j.rootCategory=INFO, FILE

# Ignore messages below warning level from Jetty, because it's a bit verbose
log4j.logger.org.eclipse.jetty=WARN

# Set the appender named FILE to be a File appender
log4j.appender.FILE=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender

# Change the path to where you want the log file to reside
log4j.appender.FILE.File=/mbo/spark/logs/SparkOut.log

# Prettify output a bit
log4j.appender.FILE.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.FILE.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss} %p %c{1}: %m%n
```

To assure that Spark will be able to find `log4j.properties`, I suggest you create a new `java-opts` file in `spark/conf/` directory and place this line inside (modify the path, of course):

```sh
-Dlog4j.configuration=file:///mbo/spark/conf/log4j.properties
```

> FYI, the same thing can be accomplished using `SPARK_JAVA_OPTS` param in `spark-env.sh`.

## Playing with Spark

We are finally ready for our first interactive session with Spark.  
To launch Spark Scala repl:

```sh
# launch scala repl
MASTER=spark://localhost:7077 ./spark-shell
```

![spark repl](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/spark-repl.png)

### Hello Spark

As a demonstration, let's use our Spark cluster to approximate _PI_ using [MapReduce algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce):  

```scala
/* throwing darts and examining coordinates */
val NUM_SAMPLES = 100000
val count = spark.parallelize(1 to NUM_SAMPLES).map{i =>
  val x = Math.random * 2 - 1
  val y = Math.random * 2 - 1
  if (x * x + y * y < 1) 1.0 else 0.0
}.reduce(_ + _)

println("Pi is roughly " + 4 * count / NUM_SAMPLES)
```

> The PI estimation algorithm is based on the fact that "throwing a dart" a large number of times (1M), each time striking randomly inside a unit square ((0, 0) to (1, 1)). We pick random points in the unit square ((0, 0) to (1,1)) and see how many fall in the unit circle. The fraction should be π / 4

If you're not comfortable with Scala, I recently wrote a [Java developer's Scala cheat sheet](http://mbonaci.github.io/scala/) (based on Programming in Scala SE book, by Martin Odersky, whose first edition is freely available [online](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/)), which is basically a big reference card, where you can look up almost any Scala topic you come across.

## Setting up Spark development environment in Eclipse

Most Spark developers use IntelliJ IDEA, but since I don't have enough will power to switch over, I'm still with Eclipse (for JVM-related stuff).  

Luckily, all you need to do to prepare Spark for opening in Eclipse is run:

```sh
sbt/sbt eclipse
```

![sbt eclipse](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/sbt-eclipse.PNG)

Which should hopefully finish like this:

![sbt eclipse success](https://raw.github.com/mbonaci/mbo-spark/master/resources/sbt-eclipse-success.PNG)

## What Spark uses under the hood?
